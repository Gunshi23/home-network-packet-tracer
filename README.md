## Network Topology

This project demonstrates a basic **home network topology** created using Cisco Packet Tracer.

### Topology Type
- **Star Topology**

### Description
- A **Wireless Router** is used as the central device.
- A **PC** is connected to the router using a copper straight-through Ethernet cable.
- The router provides **automatic IP addressing (DHCP)** to the PC.

### How It Works
- The PC requests an IP address from the router.
- The router assigns an IP address automatically.
- The PC can communicate with the router using the assigned IP address.

### Purpose of This Topology
- To understand basic home networking
- To learn how DHCP works
- To practice connecting devices in Cisco Packet Tracer

This topology represents a simple real-life home network setup.
